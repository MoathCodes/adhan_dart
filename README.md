# Adhan Dart

Adhan Dart is a port of excellent [Adhan JavaScript](https://github.com/batoulapps/adhan-js). Ported to Dart, preserving the calculation logic. Adapted to use Dart's superior DateTime class for quick and convenient time calculations. No extra dependencies (_timezone_ package used for tests, in your code you can use timezone offset instead).

Adhan Dart is a well tested and well documented library for calculating Islamic prayer times in Dart.

All astronomical calculations are high precision equations directly from the book [‚ÄúAstronomical Algorithms‚Äù by Jean Meeus](https://www.willbell.com/math/mc1.htm). This book is recommended by the Astronomical Applications Department of the U.S. Naval Observatory and the Earth System Research Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

# adhan_dart

Idiomatic Dart port of the excellent [Adhan](https://github.com/batoulapps/Adhan) prayer-times library.

**What's Different in this branch**

* **üöÄ New Immutable API** ‚Äì Introduced `PrayerTimesData.calculate()` for modern, functional prayer time calculations
  ```dart
  // Simple one-liner calculation
  final prayerTimes = PrayerTimesData.calculate(
    date: DateTime.now(),
    coordinates: coords,
    calculationParameters: params,
  );
  ```
* **üîÑ Full Backward Compatibility** ‚Äì Your existing code continues to work! Legacy `PrayerTimes` class is fully functional
* **üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Type Safety**:
  - Immutable data structures (`@immutable` classes)
  - Better null safety with non-nullable convenience methods
  - Const constructors for compile-time optimizations
* **üìä Comprehensive Testing**:
  - New 310-line API validation test suite comparing against Aladhan API
  - Real-world validation across multiple cities and calculation methods
  - Updated all existing test files for new patterns
* **‚ö° Performance Improvements**:
  - 67% faster repeated calculations through intelligent caching
  - 85% faster coordinate validation with early error detection  
  - Better memory usage with immutable objects
  - SolarCoordinates caching for repeated calculations
  - Optimized SunnahTimes calculation to avoid redundant work
  - See `PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md` for detailed benchmarks
* **üîß Developer Experience**:
  - Cleaner static factory method: `PrayerTimesData.calculate()`
  - Enhanced `copyWith()` method for `CalculationParameters`
  - Better IDE support with improved type inference
  - Consolidated utility extensions in `DateTime` and other types
* **üì¶ Updated Dependencies**:
  - Added `meta: ^1.17.0` for immutability annotations
  - Added `test: ^1.26.3` for enhanced testing capabilities
* **üßπ Code Quality**:
  - Removed redundant utility files (`DateUtils.dart`, `MathUtils.dart`)
  - Moved utilities to idiomatic Dart extensions
  - Separation of concerns: calculation logic vs data representation
  - Modern Dart patterns throughout (const constructors, extensions, etc.)

## Migration Guide

### Old API (Still Works! ‚úÖ)
```dart
// Master branch - mutable, constructor-based approach
CalculationParameters params = CalculationMethodParameters.muslimWorldLeague()
  ..madhab = Madhab.hanafi;  // Mutable modification

PrayerTimes prayerTimes = PrayerTimes(
  coordinates: coordinates,
  date: date,
  calculationParameters: params,
  precision: true
);
```

### New API 
```dart
// Refactor branch - immutable, functional approach
final params = CalculationMethodParameters.muslimWorldLeague()
    .copyWith(madhab: Madhab.hanafi);  // Immutable copyWith()

final prayerTimes = PrayerTimesData.calculate(
  date: date,
  coordinates: coordinates,
  calculationParameters: params,
  precision: true,
);

// Or even simpler with the static factory:
final prayerTimes = PrayerTimesData.calculate(
  date: DateTime.now(),
  coordinates: coordinates,
  calculationParameters: params,
);
```

### Key Differences
| Aspect | Old API | New API |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Style** | Constructor-based | Static factory method |
| **Mutability** | Mutable params (`..madhab = `) | Immutable (`copyWith()`) |
| **Type Safety** | Runtime modifications | Compile-time safety |
| **Memory** | Mutable objects | Immutable, cacheable |
| **Testing** | Harder to test state | Predictable, pure functions |

Both APIs return the same prayer time data and work identically for accessing times, utilities, and Sunnah calculations!

### Performance Benchmarks

## Quick-start

```dart
import 'package:adhan_dart/adhan_dart.dart';

void main() {
  // Coordinates for Makkah
  const coords = Coordinates(21.3891, 39.8579);
  final params = CalculationMethodParameters.ummAlQura();

  // Calculate prayer times for today
  final prayerTimes = PrayerTimesData.calculate(
    date: DateTime.now(),
    coordinates: coords,
    calculationParameters: params,
    precision: true, // Optional: for second-level precision
  );

  print('Fajr    : ${prayerTimes.fajr}');
  print('Sunrise : ${prayerTimes.sunrise}');
  print('Dhuhr   : ${prayerTimes.dhuhr}');
  print('Asr     : ${prayerTimes.asr}');
  print('Maghrib : ${prayerTimes.maghrib}');
  print('Isha    : ${prayerTimes.isha}');

  // Convenience utilities
  final current = prayerTimes.currentPrayer();
  final next = prayerTimes.nextPrayer();
  final nextPrayerTime = prayerTimes.timeForPrayer(next);
  print('Current prayer: $current');
  if (nextPrayerTime != null) {
    print('Next prayer: $next at $nextPrayerTime');
  }

  // Sunnah times
  final sunnah = SunnahTimes(prayerTimes);
  print('Middle of night: ${sunnah.middleOfTheNight}');
  print('Last third of night: ${sunnah.lastThirdOfTheNight}');

  // Qibla direction
  final qibla = Qibla.qibla(coords);
  print('Qibla direction: ${qibla.toStringAsFixed(2)}¬∞');
}
```

## Installation

Adhan was designed to work be easy to import to any Dart or Flutter project.

Insert under dependencies in your pubspec.yaml file:

```
  adhan_dart: ^1.1.1
```

Or use the latest dev version:

```
  adhan_dart:
    git:
      url: git://github.com/prayer-timetable/adhan_dart.git
```

### Import

```
import 'package:adhan_dart/adhan_dart.dart';
```

## Usage

To get prayer times, use the static `calculate` method on `PrayerTimesData` passing in a date, coordinates, and calculation parameters.

```dart
final prayerTimes = PrayerTimesData.calculate(
    date: DateTime.now(),
    coordinates: coordinates,
    calculationParameters: params,
    precision: true, // Optional: for second-level precision
);
```

### Initialization parameters

#### Coordinates

Create a `Coordinates` object with the latitude and longitude for the location
you want prayer times for.

```dart
Coordinates coordinates = Coordinates(35.78056, -78.6389);
```

#### Date

The date parameter passed in should be an instance of the Dart `DateTime`
object. The year, month, and day values can be populated. The year, month and day values should be for the date that you want prayer times for. These date values are expected to be for the
Gregorian calendar.

```dart
DateTime date = DateTime.now(); // this is default
DateTime date = DateTime(2015, 11, 1); // set specific date
```

#### Calculation parameters

The rest of the needed information is contained within the `CalculationParameters` object.
Instead of manually initializing this object it is recommended to use one of the pre-populated
objects in the `CalculationMethod` object. You can then further
customize the calculation parameters if needed.

```dart
CalculationParameters params = CalculationMethod.muslimWorldLeague();
params.madhab = Madhab.hanafi;
params.adjustments.fajr = 2;
```

### Prayer Times

Once the `PrayerTimes` object has been initialized it will contain values
for all five prayer times and the time for sunrise. The prayer times will be
DateTime object instances initialized with UTC values. You will then need to format
the times for the correct timezone. You can do that by using a timezone aware
date formatting library like _timezone_.

```dart
final timezone = tz.getLocation('America/New_York');
tz.TZDateTime.from(prayerTimes.fajr, timezone);
```

### Full Example

```dart
import 'package:adhan_dart/adhan_dart.dart';
import 'package:timezone/data/latest.dart' as tz;
import 'package:timezone/timezone.dart' as tz;

void main() {
  tz.initializeTimeZones();
  final location = tz.getLocation('America/New_York');
  final date = tz.TZDateTime.from(DateTime.now(), location);
  final coordinates = Coordinates(35.78056, -78.6389);
  final params = CalculationMethod.muslimWorldLeague();
  params.madhab = Madhab.hanafi;

  final prayerTimes = PrayerTimesData.calculate(
    date: date,
    coordinates: coordinates,
    calculationParameters: params,
    precision: true,
  );

  final fajrTime = tz.TZDateTime.from(prayerTimes.fajr, location);
  final sunriseTime = tz.TZDateTime.from(prayerTimes.sunrise, location);
  final dhuhrTime = tz.TZDateTime.from(prayerTimes.dhuhr, location);
  final asrTime = tz.TZDateTime.from(prayerTimes.asr, location);
  final maghribTime = tz.TZDateTime.from(prayerTimes.maghrib, location);
  final ishaTime = tz.TZDateTime.from(prayerTimes.isha, location);

  print('Fajr:    $fajrTime');
  print('Sunrise: $sunriseTime');
  print('Dhuhr:   $dhuhrTime');
  print('Asr:     $asrTime');
  print('Maghrib: $maghribTime');
  print('Isha:    $ishaTime');
}
```

### Convenience Utilities

The `PrayerTimesData` object has functions for getting the current prayer and the next prayer. You can also get the time for a specified prayer, making it
easier to dynamically show countdowns until the next prayer.

```dart
final prayerTimes = PrayerTimesData.calculate(
    date: DateTime.now(),
    coordinates: coordinates,
    calculationParameters: params,
);

final current = prayerTimes.currentPrayer();
final next = prayerTimes.nextPrayer();
final nextPrayerTime = prayerTimes.timeForPrayer(next);
```

### Sunnah Times

The Adhan library can also calculate Sunnah times. Given an instance of `PrayerTimesData`, you can get a `SunnahTimes` object with the times for Qiyam.

```dart
final prayerTimes = PrayerTimesData.calculate(
    date: DateTime.now(),
    coordinates: coordinates,
    calculationParameters: params,
);
final sunnahTimes = SunnahTimes(prayerTimes);
final middleOfTheNight = sunnahTimes.middleOfTheNight;
final lastThirdOfTheNight = sunnahTimes.lastThirdOfTheNight;
```

### Qibla Direction

Get the direction, in degrees from North, of the Qibla from a given set of coordinates.

```dart
var coordinates = Coordinates(35.78056, -78.6389);
var qiblaDirection = Qibla.qibla(coordinates);
```
